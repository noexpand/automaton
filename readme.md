# Automaton

Automaton is a full-stack development system based on Spring Boot, DomainQL, 
React and Mobx.

## WIP: Future Plans

JSON models are translated into database schemas and GraphQL schemas. The database
schema can be used to generate Java domain types via JOOQ.

Custom logic based query and mutation methods serve the data for an automatically
generated GraphQL schema.

Changes on the generated sources can flow back into the JSON model.
